            One of the hidden gems in Gweru and a great place for a summer day out for swimming, braai and picnic. Don't forget to pack your charcoal and cooler box with drinks, meat and lots of drinking water.It is a good idea to bring a portable braai stand as the ones on site are not enough for everyone to use, especially on summer Saturdays when the place is packed with revellers. The locals often come overdressed, just for people watching, but it is nothing to worry about. But they can be very helpful as guides, especially leading you to the shallow pools, which are accessed via a cave. The place has not been commercialised, so entry is free and there are no rules - just have fun with friends and famiy before driving back to the city.

            Danamombe_ruins is one of the "Big Four" pre-colonial ruins of Zimbabwe, ranking along with Great Zimbabwe, Khami and Nalatele. It is thought to be the eighteenth-century capital of the region- the last capital before the Zulu incursions and the expansion of colonial empires destroyed the balance of power on the Zimbabwean plateau.Today the site is seldom explored and rather remote. It is hard to get here without your own transport, as it is situated 35 kms off the main road. If you make the effort, you will be rewarded with beautiful stone walling, some of it featuring traditional Rozvi motifs. This was clearly a major pre-colonial centre, though the commoners' mud-brick dwellings no longer remain.
